  + Added a results file that shows movies agreed on, indifferent about, and maybe's in neat .txt file
  
  Now specifics:

      + added "c_master" to compare results to
          -can modify "c_master" to your liking, so results are more personal
    For drama section:
      - Drama movie list (compiled from https://www.imdb.com/list/ls009668711/)
      + added "d_master" to compare results to
          -can modify "d_master" to your own liking, so results are more personal
    For action & romance section:
      - Currently no movie list, or "x_master" - HOWEVER, you you're able to create your own movie list and master by simply creating a .txt file following the drama and comedy         section format
      - Program is now robust enough to include these sections when ran.
        - However, it will still say (Incomplete) in the movie category selection phase, but pay no mind as it will work... if done properly!
